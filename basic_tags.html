<h1>Che Guevara Biography</h1>
</center>
<p>
        Che Guevara was a legendary political activist, who gave his life for the downfall of imperialism and the
         establishment of socialism. It is through his relentless work that he became the countercultural symbol
          of rebellion and revolution. Throughout his life, Guevara held numerous profiles, that of a doctor,
           author, guerrilla leader, diplomat and military theorist. Since an early age, Guevara was disturbed 
           by the disdainful living conditions of the poor and the hardships they were undergoing. It was his 
           early expeditions that left a deep impact on him and propelled the emotions of anger and resentment
            which caused rebellion and revolution. He is known to have played a significant role in the Cuban 
            Revolution along with Fidel Castro and was essentially responsible for the victory attained against 
            the Batista regime. Post the Cuban Revolution, he shaped the economy of Cuba towards a productive and 
            prosperous future by coming out with progressive plans. He was also responsible for the magnanimous 
            increase in the literacy rate of Cuba from 60% to 96%. It was his belief of creating the consciousness 
            of ‘new man’ driven by morals rather than material incentives that has made him a revered figure in 
            the history. For the same, he was listed in the TIME magazine’s list of 100 most influential people
             of the 20th century.
